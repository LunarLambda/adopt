# ADOPT ALPHA

### See `src/demo.c` for how to use it.

### Things are very much subject to change.

### Things coming soon:

- proper documentation
- condensed options (-abc -> -a, -b, -c)
- helper function for printing help
- helper function for printing errors
- helper program for generating options array / help message from text
- minor compatibility patches (options currently start with single dash (-) only)
- a short options only function (maybe)

### This does not aim to be compatible with getopt_long or getopt_long_only.
